A sheep-herding simulation and puzzle game. CSE 20212 final project.
Designed by David Mattia, John Nolan, Guixing Lin, and Ben Gunning.

INTRODUCTION
        Our program allows the user to simulate the herd mentality of a flock of sheep within a small graphics window. The           sheep experiencemotion that is influenced by the user, other sheep, and the overall environment. The user is able to         interact with the sheep through an X marker that can direct sheep to either congregate in a certain area or flee from         said location. Additionally, the user has the power to add or remove sheep at his or her discretion.

KEY CONCEPTS
        Move Mode:
                Move mode determines how the sheep respond to the X that the user marks in the game window. Based on the                     current move mode, sheep will move either toward or away from the X, providing the user with greater                         versatility in the control and influence over the herd of sheep.
        Click Mode:
